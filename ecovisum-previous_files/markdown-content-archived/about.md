# How we work

> since 2007 we have researched developed the ideas and software that underpins our energy data monitoring service

A perfect system is effective, cheap and speedily updated. However, in reality two of the three key areas will receive more focus than the other:

- quality
- affordability
- speed

Our system is of **high quality** yet at a **low cost**, because we **slow down** the development process to allow quality and affordability to have the highest priority. We:

- **evolve software** continuously, but gradually and carefully
- **recognise** that energy management sits within complex systems
- **make room** for effective ideas by shedding ineffective ones
- **engage users** in development by making feedback a priority

We are open to systematic experimentation, while guarding against complication.
