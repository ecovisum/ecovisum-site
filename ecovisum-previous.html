<p>![Image of people using energy unthinkingly]()</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Energy and its management is famously invisible to end users <a href="https://daveeveritt.github.io/ecovisum-site/#">REF_LINK</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Energy efficiency is theoretically easy, but in practice it’s a huge challenge to monitor and optimise energy performance across large numbers of buildings in one location.</p>
<h2 id="effectiveenergymonitoring">Effective energy monitoring</h2>
<p>A large building portfolio sees regular usage changes, and energy systems need ongoing maintenance and adaptation to keep them operating efficiently. Vigilance is required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintain the energy infrastructure</li>
<li>plan suitable investments and interventions</li>
<li>respond effectively to faults as they arise</li>
<li>keep building users up-to-date</li>
</ul>
<p>Organisations have increasing access to good quality energy and water usage data from their buildings, so it is now becoming easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor buildings continually</li>
<li>identify energy usage issues</li>
<li>prepare suitable interventions</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the <strong>volume of data</strong> generated can be <strong>overwhelming</strong> and data management systems are often costly and overly complex, being designed primarily for technical users.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://daveeveritt.github.io/ecovisum-site/#page-3">our <strong>solution</strong></a></p></section>
    <section id="page-3"><h1 id="oursolution">Our solution</h1>
<p><img src="./ecovisum-previous_files/general-energy-use.png" alt="energy use"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If building users change their behaviour, they need a visible indicator of their impact on energy costs to maintain motivation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think energy management should be a distributed task with energy managers situated within a network of stakeholders.</p>
<p>We aim to allow information extracted from energy data to penetrate as deeply into that network as possible.</p>
<p>This means the communication of data in usable forms, enabling  stakeholders to take advantage of the data in creative ways.</p>
<h2 id="anewapproachtoenergymanagement">A new approach to energy management</h2>
<p>Our dashboard provides a user-friendly ‘single source of truth’ that builds on your organisation’s raw data. This facilitates dialogue between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the overview of expert energy managers</li>
<li>building users with valuable local knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>With the growing availability of excellent data, we have been able to redesign energy management information systems from the ground up, to meet these new demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>highlighting critical information for energy management</li>
<li>presenting continual updates from automatically-extracted data</li>
<li>on-demand energy management information in a usable form</li>
</ul>
<p>Very simply, we enable the right information to be available to the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>The rest is up to you.</p></section>

  <p>Our system has been in use while evolving since 2007. Here are details from some of our users</p>

<h2 id="thenusenergydashboard">The NUS Energy Dashboard</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"NUS SSO quote about dashboard here"—Quote credit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Union of Students offer our ‘Energy Dashboard’ to enhance engagement in the energy-saving campaign ‘Student Switch-Off’ (SSO). EcoVisum offers universities and student residence providers across the UK and EU intra-hall energy-saving competitions calculated from live energy data. These are displayed as ‘leaderboards’ with the highest savers at the top.</p>
<p>From a single online software service, the dashboard is available from mobile, through laptop and desktop computers, to large display screens and ‘widgets’ that can be added to websites, etc.</p>
<p>Overall, there was a significant increase in student engagement in the SSO campaign with organisations using EcoVsum’s ‘Energy Dashboard’. There are also universities outside the SSO campaign who us the software to encourage student awareness of energy usage.</p>
<h2 id="stadtnrnbergandedinet">Stadt Nürnberg and EDI-Net</h2>
<p>![EDI-Net Nürnberg image]()</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The smiley faces dashboard is helping us to further develop the [municipal energy management] policy. Because many technical measures have already been implemented, the user is now crucial to the future. The smiley faces are one very good measure to engage with users and inform building users about energy." —Eva Anlauft, Head of Municipal Energy Management, City of Nuremberg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under EDI-Net, Nürnberg maintains 34 buildings across four locations, with data displayed at increasing levels of detail on demand, from ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs.</p>
<p>By using our software, Nürnberg has been able to quantify the resulting savings, with a marked difference of XX%, equating to XXXtonnes of CO2 ???</p>
<p>Together with nine other organisations, including the Nottingham NHS, the city is committed to ongoing use of EDI-Net to maintain both awareness of and ease of use in monitoring energy use across a complex array of building and users under their management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>since 2007 we have researched developed the ideas that underpin our energy data monitoring service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The perfect system is effective, fast and cheap. However, in reality two of the three key areas will receive more focus than the other:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality</li>
<li>affordability</li>
<li>speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Our system is <strong>very affordable</strong> <strong>and</strong> of <strong>high quality</strong>, because we <strong>slow down</strong> the development process so that quality and affordability have the highest priority. Our methods are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>evolve software</strong> continuously, but gradually and carefully</li>
<li><strong>recognise</strong> that energy management sits within complex systems</li>
<li><strong>make room</strong> for effective ideas by shedding ineffective ones</li>
<li><strong>engage users</strong> in development by making feedback a priority</li>
</ul>
<p>We are open to systematic experimentation, while guarding against complication.</p>
<p>This is how we achieve and deliver <strong>high quality</strong> at a <strong>low cost</strong>.</p>
