# How we work

![EDI-Net people representing 'us'](images-temp/edi-people.png)

> since 2007 we have researched developed the ideas that underpin our product, which is now available as a service.

The perfect system is effective, fast and cheap. However, in reality two of the three key areas will receive more focus than the other:

- quality
- affordability
- speed

Our system is **very affordable** **and** of **high quality**, because we **slow down** the development process so that quality and affordability have the highest priority. Our methods are to:

- **evolve software** continuously, but gradually and carefully
- **recognise** that energy management sits within complex systems
- **make room** for effective ideas by shedding ineffective ones
- **engage users** in development by making feedback a priority

We are open to systematic experimentation, while guarding against complication.

This is how we achieve and deliver **high quality** at a **low cost**.
