# Our solution

> If building users change their behaviour, they need a visible indicator of their impact on energy costs to maintain motivation

We think energy management should be a distributed task with energy managers situated within a network of stakeholders.

We aim to allow information extracted from energy data to penetrate as deeply into that network as possible.

This means the communication of data in usable forms, enabling  stakeholders to take advantage of the data in creative ways.

## A new approach to energy management

Our dashboard provides a user-friendly ‘single source of truth’ that builds on your organisation’s raw data. This facilitates dialogue between:

- the overview of expert energy managers
- building users with valuable local knowledge

With the growing availability of excellent data, we have been able to redesign energy management information systems from the ground up, to meet these new demands:

- highlighting critical information for energy management
- presenting continual updates from automatically-extracted data
- on-demand energy management information in a usable form

Very simply, we enable the right information to be available to the right people at the right time.

The rest is up to you.
