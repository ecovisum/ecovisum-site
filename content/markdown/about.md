# How we work

![EDI-Net people representing 'us'](images/edi-people.png)

> since 2007 we have researched developed the ideas that underpin our energy data monitoring service.

The perfect system is effective, fast and cheap. However, in reality two of the three key areas will receive more focus than the other:

- quality
- affordability
- speed

Our system is **very affordable** **and** of **high quality**, because we **slow down** the development process so that quality and affordability have the highest priority. Our methods are to:

- **evolve software** continuously, but gradually and carefully
- **recognise** that energy management sits within complex systems
- **make room** for effective ideas by shedding ineffective ones
- **engage users** in development by making feedback a priority

We are open to systematic experimentation, while guarding against complication.

This is how we achieve and deliver **high quality** at a **low cost**.
