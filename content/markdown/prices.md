EDI-Net has been running successfully since 2018, with some authorities saving up to ???% on energy usage.

Organisations with regular, reliable energy data can use EDI-Net to inform building users and energy managers of live energy usage at various levels from instantly-readable ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs for detailed monitoring. See the [EDI-Net case study](#stadt-nürnberg-and-edi-net).

We built, have successfully maintained and upgraded the energy dashboard for the NUS Student Switch Off campaign since March 2014. See the [case study](#the-nus-energy-dashboard)

If you have digital metering, we can automatically process data from your supplier or metering system. If not, manual uploads (as Excel or CSV files) are fine.

### Costs:

- £1200 20 halls @ 5 meters per hall (up to 100 meters)
- £20 for each additional hall (with up to 5 meters)
- £10 for each additional meters

Once set up, competitions can be created between student residencies.
