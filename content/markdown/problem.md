# The problem

Energy efficiency is theoretically easy, but in practice itâ€™s a huge challenge to monitor and optimise energy performance across large numbers of buildings in one location.

## Effective energy monitoring

A large building portfolio sees regular usage changes, and energy systems need ongoing maintenance and adaptation to keep them operating efficiently. Vigilance is required to:

- maintain the energy infrastructure
- plan suitable investments and interventions
- respond effectively to faults as they arise
- keep building users up-to-date

Organisations have increasing access to good quality energy and water usage data from their buildings, so it is now becoming easier to:

- monitor buildings continually
- identify energy usage issues
- prepare suitable interventions

However, the **volume of data** generated can be **overwhelming** and data management systems are often costly and overly complex, being designed primarily for technical users.
