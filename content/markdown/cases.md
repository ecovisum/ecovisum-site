The National Union of Students offer our ‘Energy Dashboard’ to enhance engagement in the energy-saving campaign ‘Student Switch-Off’ (SSO). EcoVisum offers universities and student residence providers across the UK and EU intra-hall energy-saving competitions calculated from live energy data. These are displayed as ‘leaderboards’ with the highest savers at the top.

From a single online software service, the dashboard is available from mobile, through laptop and desktop computers, to large display screens and ‘widgets’ that can be added to websites, etc.

Overall, there was a significant increase in student engagement in the SSO campaign with organisations using EcoVsum’s ‘Energy Dashboard’. There are also universities outside the SSO campaign who us the software to encourage student awareness of energy usage.

## Stadt Nürnberg and EDI-Net

> "The smiley faces dashboard is helping us to further develop the \[municipal energy management] policy. Because many technical measures have already been implemented, the user is now crucial to the future. The smiley faces are one very good measure to engage with users and inform building users about energy." —Eva Anlauft, Head of Municipal Energy Management, City of Nuremberg

Under EDI-Net, Nürnberg maintains 34 buildings across four locations, with data displayed at increasing levels of detail on demand, from ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs.

By using our software, Nürnberg has been able to quantify the resulting savings, with a marked difference of XX%, equating to XXXtonnes of CO2 ???

Together with nine other organisations, including the Nottingham NHS, the city is committed to ongoing use of EDI-Net to maintain both awareness of and ease of use in monitoring energy use across a complex array of building and users under their management.
