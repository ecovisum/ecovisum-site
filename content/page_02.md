EDI-Net has been running successfully since 2018, with authorities seeing significant savings on energy and water usage:

> EDI-Net contributed to **saving more than 1,300 m3 of water** - and thus around €6,500! <small>—Alexander Nordhus, Energy Manager, City of Nuremberg, Germany</small>

> Based on the current electricity costs, **savings of around €200,000 can be made annually** regarding the 18 buildings involved <small>—Darsheet Chauhan, Team Leader, Energy Projects Team, Leicester City Council, UK</small>

> We decided to use EDI-Net in 1,171 buildings, which has entailed some setup costs. With the tool, however, we were able to demonstrate **significant savings (in excess of 22 MWh)** <small>—Juan Antonio Bas Villalobos, Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain</small>

EDI-Net informs building users and energy managers of live usage, from instantly-readable ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs for exact monitoring. See the [current EDI-Net partners](https://dashboard.edi-net.eu/p/partners).

### Costs:

- €500 5 buildings +€100 per additional building
- €1000 10 buildings +€50 per additional building
- €3000 50 buildings +€20 per additional building
- €5000 150 buildings +€10 per additional building
- €8500 500 buildings +€5 per additional building

The energy dashboard has supported the NUS Student Switch Off campaign since March 2014. See the [case study](#the-nus-energy-dashboard)

We can automatically process digital data from your supplier or metering system. Manual uploads (Excel or CSV) are also enabled.

### Costs:

- £1200 20 halls @ 5 meters per hall (up to 100 meters)
- £20 for each additional hall (with up to 5 meters)
- £10 for each additional meter

Once set up, competitions can be created between student residencies.
