**[edi-net.eu](https://www.edi-net.eu/en/)**

EDI-Net has been running successfully since 2017, with authorities seeing <strong>significant savings</strong> on energy and water usage:

> EDI-Net contributed to **saving more than 1,300 m3 of water** - and thus around €6,500! <small>—Alexander Nordhus, Energy Manager, City of Nuremberg, Germany</small>

> Based on the current electricity costs, **savings of around €200,000 can be made annually** regarding the 18 buildings involved <small>—Darsheet Chauhan, Team Leader, Energy Projects Team, Leicester City Council, UK</small>

> We decided to use EDI-Net in 1,171 buildings, which has entailed some setup costs. With the tool, however, we were able to demonstrate **significant savings (in excess of 22 MWh)** <small>—Juan Antonio Bas Villalobos, Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain</small>

EDI-Net informs building users and energy managers of live usage, from instantly-readable ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs for exact monitoring. See the [current EDI-Net partners](https://dashboard.edi-net.eu/p/partners).

### Costs:

- €500: 5 buildings +€100 per additional building
- €1000: 10 buildings +€50 per additional building
- €3000: 50 buildings +€20 per additional building
- €5000: 150 buildings +€10 per additional building
- €8500: 500 buildings +€5 per additional building

The Energy Dashboard (shown above) has successfully supported the National Union of Students [Switch Off campaign](http://studentswitchoff.org/) since March 2014, and recently won the [Class Digital Innovation Award](https://theclassof2020.org/the-class-awards-2020/) in November 2019 in Berlin, Germany. The award:

> recognizes, highlights and promotes companies and initiatives at the forefront of student living, working and learning.

The Dashboard engages students in energy-saving initiatives by tracking consumption in over 140 student halls and residences across 14 UK and EU universities, enabling them to set up competitions by showing dynamically-updated <em>leaderboards</em> of energy savings for each competitor.

The Dasboard automatically processes digital data from your supplier or metering system. Manual uploads (Excel or CSV) are also enabled.

### Costs:

- £1200: 20 halls @ 5 meters per hall (up to 100 meters)
- £20: each additional hall (with up to 5 meters)
- £10: each additional meter
